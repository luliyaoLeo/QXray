# Xray100
The SIXray dataset was constructed by the Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Development Laboratory of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and consists of 1,059,231 X-ray images. 
Among them, 8929 contraband items are marked, and the content of this data set is relatively complex and challenging. 
The contraband in the data set includes six categories of guns, knives, wrenches, scissors, hammers, and pliers. 
We further construct the SIXray100 dataset based on the SIXray dataset. The ratio of positive and negative samples in the three datasets is close to 100:1. 
The author of the SIXray dataset pointed out that the SIXray100 dataset is the closest to the actual distribution of positive and negative samples. 
Since there are only 60 sample images containing hammers, it was decided not to use hammers as a classification category.
