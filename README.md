#QX-ray
The QXray dataset was constructed by us by collecting datasets from relevant literature and materials, which contains 6060 X-ray images. Among them, 60 are marked with contraband. The content of this data set is relatively complex and challenging. Contraband items in the data set include guns, knives, wrenches, scissors, hammers, and pliers. The ratio of positive and negative samples in the dataset is close to 100:1. Related studies have concluded that this ratio is closest to the actual distribution of positive and negative samples.
